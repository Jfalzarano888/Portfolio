          <h2> Education </h2>
          <p> Before I began my web development journey, I went to Roberts Wesleyan College.
            I majored in Elementary Education and Special Education.
            Not only did I discover my love for education, but I also discovered my love for all things  technology.
            I promised myself that when I began teaching, I would use the latest technology to reach my students. </p>

            <h2> Career </h2>
            <p> After graduating and passing my board exams, I began teaching first grade.
              The school was not technologically advanced, but that did not impede me from utalizing the wonderful technology that was available.
              I even bought my own equipment to help bring technology to the classroom. </p>

            <h2> New Opportunities</h2>
            <p> While I taught, a close friend introduced me to web development.
              I began to learn a few languages and even created a few websites for friends and collegues.
              Web development started to become less of a hobby and more of a potential career choice. </p>

            <p> Now I devote my attention to web development full time.
              Creating websites is my passion and with each new project, I become better <br> at my craft.
              Let me design your website that will work across all devices and improve your business today! </p>
