                      <p> Before I began my web development journey, I went to Roberts Wesleyan College where
                            I majored in Elementary and Special Education.
                            During my studies, I discovered my love for education and technology. Whenever given the chance, I would
                            merge my two passions to create mock lessons, complete class projects, and produce engaging presentations.

                      <h2 class="center-header"> Career </h2>
                       <p> After graduating and passing 5 board exams, I was offered a job teaching first grade.
                        The school was not set up for teaching students with technology, but that did not prove to be a deterent.
                        Shortly after I received my own classroom, I equipped it with technology to enhance student learning. A year later, I was offered an additonal
                        position as a tech liaison.</p>

                           <p> However, I eventually became unhappy with education's digression into data collection and test preparation.
                        Thankfully, a close friend introduced me to web development. During my final year teaching first grade,
                        I learned a few coding languages. I even created a few websites for friends and colleagues.
                        Web development started to look like a new, potential career. </p>

                       <p> After teaching for almost three years, I left my teaching position and devoted my time to designing websites. Currently, I create websites using
                       using the programs and equipment many professionals use in their offices. My websites can even be accessed
                      on your home computer, phone, or tablet due to my responsive design approach. Please click on the contact page to set up your free consultation. I look forward to working with you!  </p>
