                      <p> Before I began my web development journey, I went to Roberts Wesleyan College.
                            I majored in Elementary Education and Special Education.
                            Not only did I discover my love for education, but I also discovered my love for all things  technology.
                            I promised myself that when I began teaching, I would use the latest technology to reach my students. </p>

                      <h2 class="center-header"> Career </h2>
                       <p> After graduating and passing my board exams, I began teaching first grade.
                        The school was not technologically advanced, but that did not impede me from utilizing the wonderful technology that was available.
                        I even bought my own equipment to help bring technology to the classroom. </p>

                           <p> While I taught, a close friend introduced me to web development.
                        I began to learn a few languages and even created a few websites for friends and colleagues.
                        Web development started to become less of a hobby and more of a potential career choice. </p>
