                      <p> Before I began my web development journey, I went to Roberts Wesleyan College.
                            I majored in Elementary Education and Special Education.
                            Through college I discovered my love for education, but I also my love for tech.
                            I promised myself that when I began teaching, I would use technology to reach all students. </p>

                      <h2 class="center-header"> Career </h2>
                       <p> After graduating and passing my board exams, I began teaching first grade.
                        The school was not set up for teaching students technology, but that did not deter me from utilizing what was currently available.
                        I quickly purchased some equipment and brought technology to the classroom. I even became an assistant tech coordinator. </p>

                           <p> While I taught, a close friend introduced me to web development.
                        I began to learn a few languages and even created a few websites for friends and colleagues.
                        Web development started to become less of a hobby and more of a new potential career. </p>

                       <p> Instead of devoting my time to teaching, I decided to devote my time to designing websites. I currently create websites using
                       using the programs and equipment many professionals use in their offices. My websites also work accross all devices so they can be accessed
                      at home or on the go. Please click on the contact page to set up your free consultation!  </p>
